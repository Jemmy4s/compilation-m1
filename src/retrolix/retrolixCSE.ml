(** This module implements the common subexpression elimination optimization. *)

(** [value_numbering cfg p] determines a mapping from the variables and
    the registers to symbolic values for each point of the program [p]. *)

     failwith "Students! This is your work!"
     </sujet. *)

(** [simplify cfg p] optimises [p] by factorizing out the redundant
    computations. *)
let simplify cfg p =
     failwith "Students! This is your work!"
     </sujet. *)
